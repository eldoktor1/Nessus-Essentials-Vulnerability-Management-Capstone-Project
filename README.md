## 🚀 Introduction

Welcome to the Nessus Essentials Vulnerability Management Guide! 🚀 In today's rapidly evolving cybersecurity landscape, being proactive against potential threats is paramount. This comprehensive guide will walk you through the process of effectively using Nessus Essentials, a powerful vulnerability scanning tool, within a Windows 10 environment. By following the step-by-step instructions provided here, you'll be equipped to identify vulnerabilities, assess risks, and implement remediation strategies, safeguarding your digital assets.

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

Before you begin your journey of vulnerability management, ensure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- VM Workstation Player installed on your host machine
- Downloaded Windows 10 ISO file for setting up the virtual environment

## 💾 Downloading Nessus

1. Start by downloading Nessus version 8.15.2 for Windows 10 from the official [Nessus website](link-to-download).
2. Save the installer file to a convenient location on your local machine.

## ⚙️ Installing Nessus

1. Run the Nessus installer you downloaded in the previous step.
2. Follow the installation prompts, agreeing to the license terms when prompted.
3. Specify the installation directory and complete the installation process.
4. Once the installation is finished, launch Nessus to proceed.

## 🛠️ Setting Up Nessus

1. Open your preferred web browser and navigate to the Nessus web interface (URL provided during installation).
2. Establish a secure connection using SSL and proceed to the advanced settings.
3. Opt for "Nessus Essentials" as your choice and continue without additional information.

## ⚙️ Initializing Nessus

During this phase, Nessus will initialize and prepare the necessary components required for effective vulnerability scanning.

## 🌐 Verifying Network Connection

1. To ensure proper network connectivity, open the Command Prompt on your local machine.
2. Ping the IP address of your VM to verify successful communication.

## 🔒 Configuring Windows Firewall on VM

1. On your VM, launch the Command Prompt and enter the command `wf.msc`.
2. Inside the Windows Defender Firewall Properties, disable the firewall for each profile (domain, private, public).
3. Validate the connectivity by pinging the VM from your local machine.

## 📊 Creating a New Scan

1. Access the Nessus web application from your host machine's web browser.
2. Initiate the creation of a new scan named "Windows 10 Single Host."
3. Input the IP address of the targeted VM in the designated field.
4. Save the scan configuration and proceed to launch the scan.

## 🕵️ Analyzing Vulnerabilities

1. Examine the scan results, taking note of the color-coded severity levels for each vulnerability.
2. Navigate to the "Vulnerabilities" tab to access the detailed list of findings.

## 🛡️ Addressing Vulnerabilities

1. Enhance vulnerability detection by enabling remote registry access on the VM.
2. Set the registry access to "Automatic," apply the change, and initiate the registry service.
3. Check if file and printer sharing is enabled in the "Advanced shared settings."

## 🔁 Running Another Scan

1. Elevate your vulnerability assessment by incorporating Windows credentials into Nessus (e.g., "admin" username and password).
2. Rerun the scan, this time with the added credentials, to perform a more comprehensive evaluation.

## 🛠️ Finalizing Remediation

1. Compare the results of the scan with the previous iterations, observing changes in vulnerability counts and severity levels.
2. Based on the findings, consider potential remediation actions and prioritize them accordingly.

## 🏁 Conclusion

Congratulations! By diligently following this guide, you've successfully navigated through the process of setting up and effectively using Nessus Essentials for vulnerability management within a Windows 10 environment. This proactive approach empowers you to identify, address, and mitigate potential security risks, fostering a more secure digital ecosystem for your valuable assets.
